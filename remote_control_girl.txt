When I dial her number
she knocks on my door.
Her channels are open
for me to explore.
She's my Mother of Pearl
She's my Remote Control Girl

She 1hangs on my heels
whenever she can
She 4won't leave my side
unless I send a command
She's my 1Milton of Berle
R 5 She's my remote control girl1

4I don't need to get out of my 1chair
4I just push her 2button and she'll be 5there

When I call her name, ya know
she's there in a flash...
To fix me some dinner
or take out the trash
Cuz she's my Dutchess of Earl
She's my Remote Control Girl
